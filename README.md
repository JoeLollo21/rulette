# It's time to...[SPIN! THAT! WHEEL!!!](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/0tP7buCigls)
This is a web verison of the game from [Dropout](https://dropout.tv)'s [*Game Changer* episode "Rulette"](https://www.dropout.tv/videos/rulette).

## How to Play
- Grab your friends (best played with 3-6 people).
- Grab a writing utensil & a pack of sticky notes, paper, or notebook page(s).
- Have one person agree to be the game host.
- Spin the virtual wheel.

### Card Types:
- **RULE**: Write down that rule (and apply it to yourself if it's on a sticky note). Until you get a modifier or the game ends, the rule applies to everything you do in-game.
- **PROMPT**: Perform that prompt following all rules. If it's successful, you get 2 points. **If someone catches you breaking a rule, _you_ get -2 points and they get 2 points.**
- **MODIFIER**: Change one of your rules, by flipping it (consult the game host or the Flip board on the site) or applying it to another player.

## Credits
- Game idea, visual assets, and sound effects from [Dropout](https://dropout.tv), formerly known as CollegeHumor.
- Wheel mechanic code (TypeScript) comes from Jeffrey Soffer's "*The Price is Right* Wheel" Vercel project.
